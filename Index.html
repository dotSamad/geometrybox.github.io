    <h1><b>INTRODUCTION ABOUT GEOMETRY TOOL BOX.</b></h1>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <p>This is my first line of code for geometry tool box.<br>Soon i'll be writing a quite few numbers of lines for
            this
            project to be done as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>In this site i am going to add some useful tools for students that can come handy in daily routine.<br>not
            going
            to make it too fancy or attractive because i want to give it look of old-skool programmes but after
            accessing
            the tool you'll be redirected to the official site of the tool where you can use it.<br>now you think that
            you
            can do it by yourslef but finding all the tools one by one is time taking so i am creating this <b>GEOMETRY
                TOOL
                BOX</b> so that it can save your time by showing all the neccesary tools on one platform and to
            accomplish your work better in time </p>
