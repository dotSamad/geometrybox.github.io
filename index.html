    <div>
        <p>This is my first line of code for geometry box.
        </p>
        <p>In this site i am going to add some useful tools for students that can come handy in daily routine.<br>The
            name "GEOMETRY BOX" comes from the product that are used in school in which there are several tools like
            protector, ruler, eraser, pencil, etc which helps us to draw cubes, squares, etc. Similarly this is the tool
            box of the internet which has the tools which can be useful for a student. I am not
            going
            to make it too fancy or attractive because i want to give it look of old-skool programmes but after
            accessing
            the tool you'll be redirected to the official site of the tool where you can use it.<br>now you may think
            that
            you
            can do it by your self, but finding all the tools one by one is time taking and it is not easy to choose
            one, so i am creating this <b>GEOMETRY
                BOX</b> so that it can save your time by showing all the neccesary and best of thier game tools on one
            platform and to
            accomplish your work better and faster.<br>For now the tools which are added on this site are enough for
            daily
            use, but as we grow if we found any other useful tool that will be added to this website for sure. Till then
            enjoy the learning and do your best. </p>
